1-Using shell expansion characters only, We need to create parent directory mfs. mfs contains 3 directories admin1,admin2,admin3. Each admin directory contains 5 directies (day1,day2,day3,day4,day5). Each day contains 5 labs files (lab1,lab2,lab3,lab4,lab5).txt

mkdir -p mfs/admin{1..3}/day{1..5}
touch mfs/admin{1..3}/day{1..5}/lab{1..5}.txt

2-Change shell prompt to permanent :
	LoginNAME@HOSTNAME-MM-DD-Current Directory$


nano ~/.bashrc

at the end of .bashrc we put 

PS1='u@\h-\D{%m-%d}-\w $'

3-Any user has W on a directory can remove any file under this directory even if he/she has no write perm on this file and not owner ?? What is the solution.
we can make the file undeletable using chattr 

Set the sticky bit on the directory

$ chmod 1777 <directory name>
Or
$ chmod +t <directory name>

When a directory has the sticky bit set, its files can be deleted or renamed only by the file owner, directory owner and the root user.

4-How normal user change is password while has has no W on /etc/shadow? How? how to do it?

ar@AR-Laptop-01-31-~ $ls -alh $(which passwd)
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 67K Jul 15  2021 /usr/bin/passwd

the 's' in the fourth position replaces the 'x' in the user section of the file permissions... it is a flag that can be set in the file permissions
that tells Linux to assume the privileges of the user that owns the executable when it is run - in this case, root.
